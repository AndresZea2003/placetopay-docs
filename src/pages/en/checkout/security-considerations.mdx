# Content security policy

If you've implemented a [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP), we provide you with the necessary directives to ensure the proper functioning of Webcheckout.

If you only declare a [default-src](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/default-src), it should be noted that it will act as the default for all other missing directives.

Domains used during session processing:

|  Dominios                        | 
|  ------------------------------- |
| https:your-domain.com |
| https://3dss.placetopay.com/     |     

This table can be updated at any time, therefore, once updated, it should be added to your content security policies.
